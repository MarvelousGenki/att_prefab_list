## Hello and welcome to the ATT prefab list

This is a community driven project to gather information on spawnable prefabs for the VR game A Township Tale.
It is based on CJ's latest itemlist for sharing &copy;2021 and will continue as its own source for bots, tutorias and the wonderful prefabulator mady by Twidge. 
Thanks guys for your hard work!

This List isn't able to spawn you stuff, nor is it the holy grail to a better world. But it will help you getting to know the tools you have on hand to build a wonderful world.
If you like to spawn one of these, use this command :

spawn [Playername] [Prefabname]

and you're good to go!

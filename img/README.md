## Working with images

To achieve a smooth workflow and a clean, professional look, all images have to meet some simple standards:

1. filenames should match the ID of the prefab they're showing. No additional characters, just the plain number.
2. all images have to be .png files. Some may have transparency.
3. all images must be square in a 1:1 ratio.

Thank you!
